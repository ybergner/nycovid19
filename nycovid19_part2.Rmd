# Part 2: Getting started with US Census data

To get census data, you can go to (https://data.census.gov/), but be warned: it is a big maze and not that easy to navigate. What the pros who make media reports do (probably) is use the US Census API to make specific requests for data. If you use it a lot, you will need an API key. This is easy enough to get, but you need to [request one here](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html). Once you have a key, you can declare it in your R code or, better for security/code-sharing, embed it in a .Renviron file. 

Here I will load the `censusapi` package (and also `dplyr` while I'm at it), and load my key. You can modify this line with your key. If you don't have one, try removing the `key=myKey` line in the code below (don't forget to remove the preceding comma as well). A lot of the queries will still work, but there is a limit to the size and number of queries per IP address.

```{r}
library(censusapi)
library(dplyr)
myKey = Sys.getenv("CENSUS_KEY") #store your key in .Renvriron
```


More importantly, you need to know what you're asking for. That means you need to know which data sets, which variables, which geographic units, etc. A 20-page [API users guide can be found here](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/data/developers/api-user-guide/api-guide.pdf). It's a lot for anyone, so you can just follow along here if you want some examples.

We will be interested in the [American Community Survey 5-Year data](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/acs-5year.html) which provide estimates aggregated over a 5-year period, revisited every two years. The last published data set, i.e., the most current one available, is from 2018.

### Census Variables

There are something like 20,000 variables available, and these can be retrieved through queries invidividually or in groups. Some useful groups for our analysis are the following

+ B01001	SEX BY AGE	
  + This has a lot of subcategories, such as Male 5-9 Years, Male 10-14 years, etc.
+ B02001	RACE (disregards Hispanic or Latino Origin)	
+ B03002	HISPANIC OR LATINO ORIGIN BY RACE	
+ B19013	MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS

For each group, a list of variables can be found on a corresponding website. For example, to find the variables in the SEX BY AGE group, you can go to https://api.census.gov/data/2018/acs/acs5/groups/B01001.html (notice the URL ending is the same as the group). There you will find variables such as

+ B01001_001E	Estimate!!Total
+ B01001_002E	Estimate!!Total!!Male
+ B01001_026E	Estimate!!Total!!Female

In any case, variables that end in E are estimates. For each one there is often a margin of error, which is the same code ending in M instead of E. Finally for both estimates and margins of error, there may be annotations (e.g. B01001_002EA and B01001_002MA), if these numbers are not straightforward. Details about annotation meanings can be found [here](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/acs-1year/notes-on-acs-estimate-and-annotation-values.html). This is just an overview of what the ACS5 variable names look like.

### Geography Units

Census data are available at many levels related to geographical units. The smallest unit is called a census "block" and typically covers between 600 and 3000 people. A collection of blocks forms a census tract (2500 to 8000 people). But US states are also divided into counties, and both state and county identifiers can be used as region selectors. Note that to use the Census API, one has to use numerical identifiers for states and counties. For example, the borough of Brooklyn is actually Kings County, New York, which is county 047 in state 36. And yes, you have to include all three digits, including the leading zero, to identify individual counties. Zipcode tabulation areas (aka ZCTA) is another option, wherein you specify the five-digit zip code. We will want to use that, because NYC provided COVID-19 testing data at the zipcode level. 

#### Borough-level data

First, let's retrieve some data about the five boroughs. Let's start with the simplest example and get the size of each borough population.

We will need to request the variable B01001_001E, which is the total population estimate. 

```{r echo=TRUE}
acs_boro_population <- getCensus(name = "acs/acs5",
                         vintage = 2018,
                         vars = c("NAME", "B01001_001E"),
                         region = "county:005,047,061,081,085",
                         regionin = "state:36" #, key = myKey
                         )

acs_boro_population
```

Cool! We've established that we can pull some borough-level information from the US Census to complement data provided by the city or state. Note that the two tables, the one from NYC and the one from the census, don't exactly match up. For one thing, the county names do not align with the borough names.

#### Using named vectors as look-up tools

Now, we can fix this by hand, but there are good ways and less good ways to do this. Ideally, we create a look-up table which we can reuse whenever we need to switch between borough and county names. For those familiar with database "join" operations, it is indeed possible to use joins in R. However, a simple way to just convert between two different representations (e.g., country name and borough name) is to use "named vectors" in R. Here's how:

```{r}
# Borough names
boroNames <- nyc_boro_data$BOROUGH_GROUP[1:5]
# County names
countyNames <- population_boro$NAME

# combine, but note that the order is not the same! So we'll reorder
boro2county <- data.frame(Borough=boroNames, County=countyNames[c(5,2,3,1,4)], stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# create two 'named vectors'
# one for getting the borough
getBoro <- boro2county$Borough
names(getBoro) <- boro2county$County

# one for getting the county
getCounty <- boro2county$County
names(getCounty) <- boro2county$Borough

```

Here's is one way we can use this new lookup table. Note that `getBoro` is not a function (it is a named vector). So we use square brackets to index it, not parentheses.

```{r}
getBoro["Richmond County, New York"]
getCounty["Brooklyn"]
```

```{r}
acs_boro_population$Borough <- getBoro[acs_boro_population$NAME]
acs_boro_population
```

All that remains is that annoying variable name B01001_001E for Total Population. We should definitely fix this, and there are a few ways to do it. The following may seem like a long-winded way to go about it, but it has the benefit that it will work no matter where the variable B01001_001E appears. It won't accidentally change the wrong column name, and it won't do anything at all if the variable you are trying to rename doesn't exist.

```{r}
names(acs_boro_population)[which(names(acs_boro_population)=="B01001_001E")] <- "TotalPop"
names(acs_boro_population)[which(names(acs_boro_population)=="NAME")] <- "countyName"
acs_boro_population
```

With this in hand, we can now combine our NYC COVID-19 data with our Census data. Recall 

```{r}
nyc_boro_data
```

We will make some judicious use of dplyr here to simplify the outcome. Mostly, we want to get rid of unnecessary columns from the ACS table (using `select`), and then use `join()` to merge the two tables.

```{r}
boro_join <- acs_boro_population %>% select(Borough, countyName, TotalPop) %>% 
  left_join(nyc_boro_data, by=c("Borough" =  "BOROUGH_GROUP"))
boro_join
```

Woohoo! (I'm keeping countyName for later. You'll see why.)

**Worked Example**: Compute the population adjusted rate per 100,000 people using population data from the census. How does it differ from the age-adjusted rate? 

We can use our population estimates (keep in mind that these are 5-year averages as of 2018) to derive our own rate-per-100,000 as follows

```{r}
boro_join$Rate2 <-  round(boro_join$COVID_CASE_COUNT/boro_join$TotalPop * 100000, 2)
boro_join
```

You'll notice that our rate, which is not age-adjusted, differs somewhat from the NYC rate, which is age-adjusted. Aside from age-adjustment, it is possible that our population numbers (based on 5-year averages) are different from the latest NYC populations estimates. If our population numbers are lower, then our rates would be higher. Or the difference could be a result of the age-adjustment formula.

#### More variables: income, age, and race

To request the median household income we will request the variable "B19013_001E" (intuitive, right!) Alternatively, the variable B20017_001E is earnings per person not by household

```{r echo=TRUE}
acs_boro_income <- getCensus(name = "acs/acs5",
                         vintage = 2018,
                         vars = c("NAME", "B19013_001E", "B20017_001E"),
                         region = "county:005,047,061,081,085",
                         regionin = "state:36", #key = myKey
                         )

names(acs_boro_income)[which(names(acs_boro_income)=="B19013_001E")] <- "MedHHIncome"
names(acs_boro_income)[which(names(acs_boro_income)=="B20017_001E")] <- "MedIncome"
acs_boro_income
```
There it is, five-year averages, inflation-adjusted for 2018 dollars, by borough. (If you see one-year estimates, they may  be a bit higher than these numbers, if wages went up faster than inflation).

We can add these new income variables to the table we've started to build

```{r}

# Note that I am renaming NAME to countyName in the select(), so I didn't have to do it ahead of time
left_join(boro_join, 
          acs_boro_income %>% select(countyName=NAME, MedHHIncome, MedIncome), 
          by="countyName")

```

In the next part of the series, we will keep assembling more variables related to age and race. We will also change our unit of analysis to zipcode tabulation areas.
