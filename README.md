Tutorials for combining NYC and US Census data on COVID prevalence by neighborhood   

Interactive LearnR lab located here: https://ybergner.shinyapps.io/Covid_lab/ 

These tutorials provide more instructional details and can be modified to make your own census queries. If you want to interact with some preloaded data and just practice generating plots and tables, the LearnR lab is sufficient.
